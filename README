 You will find most of the contents of this repository self-explanatory.
 I suggest you follow the instructions below for your basic setup



###
On your Beaglebone, please include the following two commands in ~/.profile 
and remember to type "source ~/.profile" at the command prompt to activate:

export SLOTS="/sys/devices/platform/bone_capemgr/slots"
export PINS="/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins"

###
Then, using the visudo command, make sure you include the following two lines:

Defaults        env_keep += "SLOTS"
Defaults        env_keep += "PINS"
